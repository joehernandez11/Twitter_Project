  As I thought about how I was going to start this assignment I thought of languages and what exactly I had to do. So far I only
  confirmed the language in which I will be coding. This language will be C# becuase I feel comfortable with that language and
  because if I get stuck or if I forgot how to do something I have resources more readily available for that language.
