  As I thought about how I was going to start this assignment I thought of languages and what exactly I had to do. So far I only
  confirmed the language in which I will be coding. This language will be C# becuase I feel comfortable with that language and
  because if I get stuck or if I forgot how to do something I have resources more readily available for that language.
  
  After some initial thoughts and/or possible theories of how to start, I have concluded that the best route would be just to start somewhere and observe the course in which it proceeds. 
  
  I will begin by implementing some List(s) to break down the text into sections and possibly varify each section. Some will be words while others will be users or mentions or topics.


All references and aid came from the introduction to Computer Science in C# textbook. It was of great help to reference that text to accurately format (remember how to format) the code.
