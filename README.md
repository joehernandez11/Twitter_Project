# Twitter_Project
ReadMe

 This project's purpose is to mimic the Twitter messaging engine. It is supposed to take a "tweet" and varify mentions, topics, URLs, and users.I will begin by implementing some List(s) to "Split" the text into sections and possibly varify each section. Some will be words while others will be users or mentions or topics. I will continue by implimenting a counter to ensure that the Tweet does not exceed 140 characters.
 
  As I thought about how I was going to start this assignment I thought of languages and what exactly I had to do. So far I only
  confirmed the language in which I will be coding. This language will be C# becuase I feel comfortable with that language and
  because if I get stuck or if I forgot how to do something I have resources more readily available for that language.

All references and aid came from the introduction to Computer Science in C# textbook. It was of great help to reference that text to accurately format (remember how to format) the code. The Slack chatter also played a role in the brainstorming phase of my work. Hearing what worked and didn't work for some people was good to keep in mind. However, since we are all coding in different languages some tasks are done better in a certain language. I came up with this simple idea and seeing if it would work. I hope I wasn't too far off the right path.
